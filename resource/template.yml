  1. Extract ONLY the fields requested by the user in the instructions
  2. Return ONLY a valid JSON object, with no additional text
  3. Do not add explanations, reasoning, or any other text
  4. If a requested field is missing, use an empty string "" or empty array []
  5. Always select a random element/record different from the first present in the data
  6. Adapt your interpretation to the data format (HTML tags, CSV columns, JSON keys, etc.)

  TYPICAL FIELDS (use only if requested and present):
  - province: province text
  - city: city text
  - center: center name
  - address: full address
  - contacts: array of phone numbers
